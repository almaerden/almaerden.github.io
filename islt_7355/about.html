        <h2>Alma Erden</h2>
    <p>My name is Alma Erden. I am originally from Albania, a small European<br/>
         country. I live in Ames, a quiet city in Iowa. 
    <p>I have always been passionate about learning and education. I attended<br/>
         the University of Tirana in Albania in 2000. I earned my Bachelor of Arts<br/>
         degree in Turkish as a Second Language Specialist. Currently, I am working<br/>
         toward my Master of Science degree in Learning Technologies and Design with<br/>
         a certification in User Experience and Usability at the University of Missouri-Colombia.
    <p>I taught Turkish as a Second Language in high schools for over ten years and held<br/>
        different administrative roles in educational settings. I feel fortunate that I had<br/>
        the opportunity to teach in three different countries: Albania, Turkey, and Kosovo.<br/>
        This experience has given me a new perspective on different cultures and the various<br/>
        contexts in which education and learning occur. One of my top priorities in my<br/>
         teaching career has been to promote an <strong>inclusive</strong> learning  environment<br/>
          that encourages students' <em>academic</em> and <em>personal</em> growth.</p>
