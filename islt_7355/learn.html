<h2 class="introheading">Introduction</h2>
                      
<p>Today, almost everything is fast-paced, including technology, education, culture,and society.
The high societal expectations on college students to perform various  undefined, inconsistent, 
and unachievable roles in society's present socio-cultural, economic, and bureaucratic contexts 
cause heavy stress on college students. Consequently, the current generation of students is 
much more stressed out and anxious when compared to previous generations. Academic stress is
one of the top issues affecting college students' success and well-being (Agolla & Ongori, 2009).
Most students have trouble with reading and writing assignments (Akabuike & Asika, 2012).
The level of writing required is higher and in greater quantity than what was expected in high
school. Assignments may require several readings and much more time than students allot. 
Students develop anxiety about their performance (Bedewy & Gabriel,
2015). When stress, worry, and anxiety overwhelm us, it makes it harder to focus and get things
done. National studies of college students have repeatedly found that emotional health challenges
like stress, anxiety, sleep, and depression are the leading impediments to academic success. 
This article aims to assist college students, parents, and educators in deepening their understanding
of academic stress, how it relates to academic workload, and how we can cope with it to have a 
thriving college experience.</p><br>

 <h2>1.The Presence of Academic Stress and its Signs</h2>  

<p>No one is exempted from experiencing stress in college. Many mental health issues emerge among 
students during their university years (Pedrelli et al., 2015). Literature shows that academic
workload is the top-rated stressor of academic stress (Chawla & Sachdeva, 2018). College 
studets struggle to comprehend and get through the amount of reading texts at the tertiary level. 
Stress occurs when individuals confront a situation they perceive as overwhelming and cannot cope 
with (Lazarus & Folkman, 1980). Academic stress is defined as the body's response to academic-related
demands that exceed the adaptive capabilities of students (Wilks, 2008). The effects of stress on
college students can be long or short-term, acute or chronic. Stress is not just a physical reaction;
it can also affect your emotions, behavior, and cognition. Just as everyone is stressed by 
different things, everyone experiences its effects in different ways. Certain signs of stress
can be confused with other ailments. Be sure to understand how it affects you so you can 
correctly identify when you are experiencing stress. Some of the most common signs and symptoms
include:</p>

<ul class="ul-learnsigns">
<li>Feeling worried and anxious all the time</li>
<li>Fatigue and lack of energy</li>
<li>Stomachaches and headaches</li>
<li>Withdrawing from peers and social activities</li>
<li>Difficulty sleeping, or sleeping too much</li>
<li>Problems with focusing and concentrating</li>
<li>Disordered eating</li>
<li>Using alcohol, drugs, or other substances as way to cope with stress.</li>
</ul>

<p>Agolla and Ongori (2009) reveal that signs of academic stress appear in many forms: feeling 
discouragedabout academic progress, lack of confidence in the quality of work, sleep changes or being tired
all the time, and unusual weight gain or weight loss. Authors emphasize that a large percentage
of students experience symptoms of academic stress while on campus, like anxiety, nervousness,
and indigestion problems. Besides, in their study, Agolla and Ongori found out that some 
students even had suicidal thoughts resulting from academic stress. 
Students develop high stress, tend to procrastinate, and neglect responsibilities such as
completing assignments and meeting deadlines. Of course, this affects their study skills and 
the quality of their work. Not only does workload stress reduce student success, but it also 
affects their physical and mental health. According to Stewart et al. (2006), academic stress
 may be expressed in various ways, including poor academic work, frayed personal relationships, 
 eating disorders, alcohol, and drug abuse, disruptive behavior, and depression. 
Academic-related stress appears to reduce academic achievement, decrease motivation and 
increase the risk of school dropout. Thus, stress resulting from academic workload affects
 students' life more each day regardless of the geographical region, major field, or grade level.</p>

<h2>2. Sources of Academic Stress</h2>
<div>

</div>
         
<p>Academic stress among college students and its causes have been extensively investigated.
Most research examines stressors such as homesickness, financial stress, adjusting to a new 
environment, and coping strategies. Bedewy and Gabriel (2015) identified various stressors: too 
many assignments, homesickness, financial issues, and adjusting to a new social environment.
The literature gives evidence of a global range of trends in academic stress. For example,
in Allahabad, India, the first-year medical students perceived the workload and group activity-related
stressors as the common academic stressor experienced (Chawla & Sachdeva, 2018). Based on their 
grade level, students` academic stress is rising, showing that first-year students are associated
with a lower level (Elias et al., 2011). The authors conducted their study at the University
Putra Malaysia, and they especially stress the growing concern that academic stress is 
affecting students` achievement. Along with the considerable number of stressors that trigger stress
in college life, previous studies have identified academic workload as the top academic 
stressor (Ong & Cheong, 2009; Chawla & Sachdeva, 2018). Agolla and Ongori (2009) also explain 
that long reading assignments, tests, and fear of failing, were the common stressors. 
College academic workload is significantly more involved than the high school workload. With
challenging classes, coordinating scheduling issues, demanding tests, and other academic obstacles, 
many new and returning students find themselves overwhelmed and studying long, hard hours (Khatib, 2014).
Previous research shows that both undergraduate and graduate students experience excessive academi
c stress related to academic workload (Bedewy & Gabriel, 2015). The authors first developed a
Perception of Academic Stress Scale (PAS). Later, Bedewy and Gabriel used the instrument to elicit
the perceptions about the sources of academic stress of the graduate and undergraduate students of
an Educational Psychology program at Tanta University, Egypt. Their study confirms the previous
studies identifying the excessive workload, lengthy assignments, and worries about failing
examinations as top-rated academic stress sources. Previous studies show that there is also
a negative relationship between perceived academic stress and time management. Higher time management
and lower perceived stress are associated with high academic achievement levels (Khatib, 2014).
 According to the author, the time concept is a problem for university students' academic and social lives.
In trying to read all the books and chapters assigned, meet paper deadlines, and participate 
in extracurricular activities, university students may become overwhelmed with the feeling that
there is not enough time to adequately complete all their work, leading to increased stress levels.
Universities have counseling centers that provide mental health care for students and primarily address
stress and anxiety. Though, there is a need for more educational programs and training that address
stressors like academic load by preparing students academically and providing opportunities for 
students to develop skills that promote success.</p>

<h2>3.Coping Strategies</h2>
<div>

<p>Experiencing negative events does not always mean that future goal attainment is perceived as 
unlikely. For many people, stress is a burst of energy that advises them on what to do. In small 
doses, stress might have many advantages. For instance, stress can help people meet daily challenges
and motivate them to reach their goals. In fact, stress can help people accomplish tasks more efficiently.
Aspinal and Talor (1992) explain that many students experience negative events and feel upset but also 
believe that they can cope successfully and, as a result, become motivated to achieve their goals.
Folkman and Lazarus (1985) examined how students cope with negative events. Three stages were identified:</p>

<ul class="ul-learngoals">
<li>1.	Primary appraisal of the situation or realizing the threat</li>
<li>2.	Secondary appraisal or bringing to mind the potential responses that can be made</li>
<li>3.	Coping or the execution of coping responses</li>
</ul>

<p>Two ways of coping have been identified within this process: (a) Problem-Focused
Coping (PFC) and (b) Emotion-Focused Coping (EFC). Problem-focused coping involves
houghts, actions, and strategies geared toward removing or diminishing a stressful
event or its impact and tends to operate when people believe that something can 
be done to alter their situation. Emotion-focused coping involves thoughts, 
actions, and strategies to manage and reduce distressing emotions associated
with a threatening event and is invoked when one perceives that a stressormust be endured (Folkman & Lazarus, 1980). 
Research shows that students` coping styles and motivation mediate academic stress 
and course grades. Problem-focused coping leads to lower academic stress and better grades,
 whereas emotion-focused coping does not (Struthers & Menec, 2000). Identifying problem-focused 
 coping as a significant predictor of academic-related stress may help students have a less 
 stressful and more fulfilling college career (Renk & Smith, 2007). The authors discovered 
 that academic-related stress levels would decrease as more problem-focused strategies were 
 employed. The findings imply that college students find problem-focused coping strategies 
 more effective when dealing with academic-related stress. Those results are also confirmed
  by Kariv and Heiman (2005). Their findings suggest that the academic workload can predict
   academic stress perceptions. Besides, objective academic workload such as class hours and
    study hours during the semester and exam periods was correlated with problem-focused coping.
Identifying academic workload as the top stressor has been an essential first step to better
 understanding and approaching academic stress management in college students. 
Research shows that improving reading skills leads to better comprehension and enhances 
students` achievement. Therefore, improving reading skills help students overcome one of
 the biggest challenges in college years: academic workload and, therefore, academic stress (Livingston et al., 2015).</p>

<p><strong>Here are some practical ways to reduce Academic stress emphasized by 
Lucier (2019):</strong><p>

<p><strong>Take a Good Look at Your Course Load</strong><br>
According to the author, if you feel overwhelmed by your course load, look at
 the number of units you take. If you can drop a class without adding more stress
  to your life, you should consider it.
</p>
<p><strong>Join a Study Group</strong><br>
According to Lucier (2019), you can study 24/7, but if you are not studying effectively,
all that time spent with your nose in your books may be causing you more stress. Consider
participating in a study group. It will hold you accountable for completing tasks on time,
will help you better understand the material, and will allow you to combine social time
with your homework.</p>

<p><strong>Get help from a peer tutor</strong><br>
If you are not sure whom to ask in your class, check with some of campus' academic support
     offices to see if they have peer tutoring programs, ask your professor if he or she can 
     recommend a peer tutor, or look for flyers on campus from other students offering 
     themselves as tutors.</p>

<p><strong>Learn How to Study More Effectively</strong><br>
If you do not know how to study effectively, it does not matter whether you 
study alone, in a study group, or with a private tutor. Make sure that your
study efforts correspond to what your brain needs to retain and truly understand 
the material.</p>

<p><strong>Incorporate more anticipation into your life.</strong><br>
There is always something to look forward to. As cited by Sorbara (2015), 
studies in Shawn Achor's book, The Happiness Advantage, show that simply
scheduling an enjoyable event increases endorphin levels in your brain by 27%.
The best part is that this enjoyable occasion does not have to be large.
It can be a movie date, a coffee date with a friend, or a walk somewhere new.
 The book also demonstrated that every time you are reminded of this event,
your happiness would increase. Whatever else is going on in the lab, make sure
to schedule something enjoyable twice a week. It will keep you excited throughout
the week and help you stave off academic stress.</p>

<p><strong>Do regular exercise.</strong><br>
According to a Harvard study (Exercise Is an All-Natural Treatment 
to Fight Depression - Harvard Health, 2013), a regular exercise routine ha
s been shown to reduce symptoms of mild to moderate depression. If you cannot
find the motivation on your own, find an exercise buddy who will help you step
away from the books to do something active outside.</p>

<p><strong>Surround yourself with supportive people.</strong><br>
The only way to stay positive is to surround yourself with people who inspire
and motivate you to be a better person while also helping others do the same.</p>

<p><strong>Stop comparing yourself with others.</strong><br>
It is easy to get caught up in comparing your success to the success of others.
You do not have the same background, resources, or personal situation as someone else. 
Instead of comparing yourself to others, consider comparing yourself to your former self.
How much more do you understand now than you did a year ago? How much more do you know
now than you did five years ago? Learn to appreciate your progress. Learn to celebrate
your own and your colleagues' successes, no matter how small. This will lead to more 
success and a more positive and productive mindset.</p>
