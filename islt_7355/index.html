        <h3>Purpose and Goals</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the <strong>'Academic Stress among College Students' </strong>website!<br/>
            A resource that raises awareness among students, their families, and educators<br/>
            about Academic Stress, its sources, and ways to cope with it. </p>
        <p>College students represent society's investment for the future. Their well-being<br/>
            is important not only in its own right but also as a factor contributing<br/>
           to the larger society's well-being. Academic Stress is a serious and growing issue<br/>
            affecting students' college careers. For some students, this type of stress is manageable<br/>
            and even beneficial, providing needed motivation and energy; however, for others,<br/>
            Academic Stress can become so severe that it interferes with their ability to focus<br/>
             and concentrate.</p>
