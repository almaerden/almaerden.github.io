        <p id="welcomeparagraph">Welcome to the <strong>'Academic Stress among College Students' </strong>website!
            A resource that raises awareness among students, their families, and educators
            about Academic Stress, its sources, and ways to cope with it.
            <br>
            <br> 
            College students represent society's investment for the future. Their well-being
            is important not only in its own right but also as a factor contributing
           to the larger society's well-being. Academic Stress is a serious and growing issue
            affecting students' college careers. For some students, this type of stress is manageable
            and even beneficial, providing needed motivation and energy; however, for others,
            Academic Stress can become so severe that it interferes with their ability to focus
             and concentrate.</p>
